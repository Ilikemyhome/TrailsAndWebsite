        What You'll need
    </h1>
    <h2>This three trail aren’t too strenuous, so you can definitely do this one with a simple day bag – no fancy gear required!</h2>

    <h3>Hiking Shoes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In the summer, I really like hiking in my Chaco sandals. They’re more comfortable than boots (to me), and give my toes some freedom. The Rattlesnake Ledge trail is well maintained and pretty easy, so as long as you watch your step you should be okay.</li>

        <li>If it’s rained recently, I would recommend hiking boots – the trail can get muddy. My favorite hiking boots are my Danner boots – they’re cute, comfortable, and waterproof!</li>

        <li>If you don’t hike very often, it’s totally okay to hike this one in sneakers! Waterproof ones are ideal for hiking in Washington, because trails are often muddy and rain can happen at basically any moment. These Lowa Maddox shoes are great for hiking and comfy for everyday wear, and are waterproof!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rain Jacket or Windbreaker</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Washington’s weather can be moody – so it’s good to be prepared with rain gear! Once you get to the top, it’ll be a lot more exposed, and it gets cold fast once you aren’t hiking uphill. I definitely recommend wearing layers for this hike!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Backpack</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You need somewhere to put your snacks! And your hiking gear, of course. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hydration!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Especially when you’re hiking or exploring outdoors, it’s important to stay hydrated! Single use water bottles are, of course, terrible for the environment, so avoid that and bring a reusable one!</li>
    </ul>
